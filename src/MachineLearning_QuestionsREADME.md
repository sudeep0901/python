4.       What is rss?
5.       State the assumptions in a linear regression model.
6.       What is the use of regularization? Explain L1 and L2 regularization.
7.       Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization
8.       How to choose the value of the parameter learning rate (α)?
9.       How to choose the value of the regularization parameter (λ)?
10.   Can we use linear regression for time series analysis?
11.   How does multicollinearity affect the linear regression?
12.   homoscedasticity and homoscedasticity?
13.   What is the normal form (equation) of linear regression? When should it be preferred to the gradient descent                          method?
14.   You run your regression on different subsets of your data, and in each subset, the beta value for a certain variable varies wildly. What could be the issue here? - correlation
