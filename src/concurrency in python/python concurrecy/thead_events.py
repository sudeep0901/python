# Signaling Between ThreadsÂ¶
# Although the point of using multiple threads is to spin separate operations off to run concurrently, there are times when it is important to be able to synchronize the operations in two or more threads. A simple way to communicate between threads is using Event objects. An Event manages an internal flag that callers can either set() or clear(). Other threads can wait() for the flag to be set(), effectively blocking progress until allowed to continue.
