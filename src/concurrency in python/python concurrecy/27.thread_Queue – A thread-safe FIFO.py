# The Queue module provides a FIFO implementation suitable for multi-threaded programming. 
# It can be used to pass messages or other data between producer and consumer threads safely. 
# Locking is handled for the caller, so it is simple to have as many threads as you want working with the same Queue instance. 
# A Queueâ€™s size (number of elements) may be restricted to throttle memory usage or processing.
