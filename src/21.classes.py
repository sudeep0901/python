# A class defines a set of attributes that are associated with, and shared by, a collection of
# objects known as instances. A class is most commonly a collection of functions (known
# as methods), variables (which are known as class variables), and computed attributes
# (which are known as properties).

# Instances of a class are created by calling a class object as a function
